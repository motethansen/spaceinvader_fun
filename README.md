Wes and Mikes space fun


install:
``` shell
python -m venv .venv
```

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install pygame
```

```bash
python space_invader.py  to run the game
```

The sprite.py is the sprite animation class, which was tested with several pixil files.
only two of the sprites were used in the game for now.
